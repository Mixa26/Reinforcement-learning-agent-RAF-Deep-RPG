# RafRpgFront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`--host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check` is needed so you can call the app from other devices in the same network.
